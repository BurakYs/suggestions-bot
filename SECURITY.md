# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest master branch is actively maintained and any security patches will be applied to that branch.

Older versions will not have patches back ported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### TLDR

We recommend opening a security advisory on GitHub, as per the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

Alternatively, reach out to the maintainers via discord (`@skelmis`).

### Your research

We ask that anyone conducting testing:
- Makes every effort to avoid impacting other users of our systems
- Avoids any activities that disrupt, degrade or interrupt our services or may compromise other user data. This includes things such as spam, brute forcing, DoS, etc
- Keeps vulnerability information private until we have had the ability to roll out fixes


### Our commitment

If you meet the expectations laid out, we commit to:
- Acknowledge any reports and keeping you informed of how we are tracking on fixes
- Acting in good faith when interacting with you
- Recognising your contribution via means such as security advisories on the affected services and/or CVE's


We will aim to fix any issues ASAP, however as we are not a dedicated resource this may not always be possible. As such, we aim for full resolution to all acknowledged issues within a 90-day period. If this is not possible, we will enter discussions with you as to the reason for delays.


### Report details

At a minimum, your report should contain:
- The affected service
- A description of the vulnerability
- Complete reproduction steps

You may include other items to your report as you please. Some examples may be:
- The perceived impact
- The perceived likelihood of exploitation
- A list of users to credit for the disclosure
